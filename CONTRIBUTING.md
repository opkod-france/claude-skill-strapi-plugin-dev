## File Structure

| File | Purpose | When to Edit |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `SKILL.md` | Core skill definition | Adding fundamental concepts, API references |
| `patterns.md` | Advanced patterns and techniques | Adding reusable patterns, best practices |
| `examples.md` | Complete code examples | Adding real-world implementations |

## Content Guidelines

### Adding New Patterns

When adding to `patterns.md`:

1. Use clear section headers with `##`
2. Include code examples with proper TypeScript/TSX syntax highlighting
3. Explain when and why to use the pattern
4. Reference official Strapi documentation where applicable

### Adding New Examples

When adding to `examples.md`:

1. Provide complete, runnable code
2. Include file paths as comments (e.g., `// server/src/services/task.ts`)
3. Add a summary table of key patterns demonstrated
4. Ensure code follows Strapi v5 conventions

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code examples
- Use proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include type annotations
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow Strapi naming conventions:
  - Content types: singular (`task` not `tasks`)
  - UIDs: `plugin::plugin-name.content-type`

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority

- New Strapi v5 patterns not yet covered
- Admin panel component examples
- Content Manager customization patterns
- Database query optimizations
- Security best practices

### Nice to Have

- Migration guides from Strapi v4
- Testing patterns for plugins
- CI/CD examples for plugin development
- Performance optimization tips
